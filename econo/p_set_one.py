# Problem 2: Suppose the following equation describes the relationship between the average number of classes missed during a semester(missed) and the distance from school ( distance, measured in miles):
import numpy as np
distance = np.array([5.0, 10.0, 20.0])

def missed(distance):
        missed = 3 + 0.2*(distance)
        return missed   
information = missed(distance)
